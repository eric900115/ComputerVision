# HW1 Image Features
This repository contains code for the CS6550 Computer Vision Homework 1 - Image Features. The purpose of this assignment is to implement Harris Corner Detection and SIFT interest point detection and matching on various images.

## Usage
To execute HW1-1, navigate to the ./NTHU-ComputerVision/hw1-Image-Features/1 directory and run the following commands:

```bash
# Run 1a_notredame with normal result (without rotation and scalar)
python3 HW1-1.py 1a_notredame False

# Run chessboard-hw1 with normal result (without rotation and scalar)
python3 HW1-1.py chessboard-hw1 False

# Run 1a_notredame with rotation and scalar
python3 HW1-1.py 1a_notredame True

# Run chessboard-hw1 with rotation and scalar
python3 HW1-1.py chessboard-hw1 True
```
To execute HW1-2, navigate to the ./NTHU-ComputerVision/hw1-Image-Features/2 directory and run the following command:

```bash
python3 HW1-2.py
```
